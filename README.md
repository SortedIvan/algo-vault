# algo-vault
This repository is dedicated to storing all of my personal leetcode submissions with full solutions. In the future, this repo will have a small dedicated server that will be connected to my personal website.

- The stuff under algos are implementations of algorithms and datastructures that I test with Catch and Cmake. 

- The stuff under src_dump: these are not meant to be "clean" solutions, I just ctrl + c, ctrl + v my solution directly into here to have it as quick and easy look up.
